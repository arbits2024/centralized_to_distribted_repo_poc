# Jenkins Pipeline 

# Spring Boot Application
This is a sample Spring Boot application using Maven as the build tool. This README will guide you through the development process and help you set up a Jenkins pipeline for continuous integration and deployment.

## Summary of advantages of moving from Centralized Source Code to Distributed Version Control.

**Offline Capabilities**: Developers can work offline because they have a full copy of the repository on their local machines. This is especially useful when internet access is limited or unstable.

**Faster Operations**: Local operations such as commits, merges, and branches are much faster in a DVCS since they don't require a network connection.

**Improved Collaboration**: Distributed version control facilitates branching and merging, allowing multiple developers to work on different features simultaneously. This reduces bottlenecks and increases productivity.

**Robust History and Audit Trail**: DVCS maintains a complete history of every change, including who made the change and why. This allows for better tracking and rollback capabilities.

**Reduced Server Load**: Since every developer has a full copy of the repository, most operations can be done locally. This reduces the load on the central server.

**Enhanced Flexibility**: Developers can work independently on different features and then merge changes when they're ready. This leads to more agile and flexible workflows.

**Better Backup and Redundancy**: Distributed version control ensures that multiple copies of the repository exist, providing a natural backup in case of server failure.

**Easier Code Review and Collaboration**: Developers can share changes with others easily and review code in a collaborative environment.

**Community Contribution:** DVCS is popular in open-source projects because it allows external contributors to fork a project and propose changes easily.

**Simple Branching and Merging:** Branching and merging are integral parts of DVCS, making it easier to manage multiple versions of the codebase and integrate changes smoothly.

**Global Collaboration:** Developers from different locations can contribute easily, share code, and collaborate more effectively without relying on a central server.

Examples of popular DVCS include Git and Mercurial. Moving to a DVCS can significantly improve the efficiency and scalability of development workflows.
